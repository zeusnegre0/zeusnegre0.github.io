 		<p>Following are excerpts from an exclusive CNBC interview with Geoff Cutmore and Travis Kalanick, CEO and Co-Founder of Uber.


GC: So let me just start by asking you about your ambition for Uber and where the business is now globally compared to where you'd like it to be? 
<br></br>
TK: I mean, really Uber is one of these wild rides that you can't totally plan for and so the way we approach the business is slightly different we sort of take it, I don't wanna say, I mean we do plan in the business, but from the entrepreneurs perspective it's about solving problems. It's about what are the interesting, complex, worthwhile, valuable problems to solve and we go after them. You could have never predicted where we are now and I don't know if I could predict where we are going. And so, one way I like to describe this is, being at Uber, you know, whether it's myself running it or any of my employees, it's like you're driving a car down the road, pretty good clip, but its foggy. And so you've really gotta hold on to that steering wheel and you gotta keep your eyes on the road. You don't have enough time to look back at where you've been and you can only see so far ahead, but we enjoy the journey every day. So, look, our mission is transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone and we've got a long way to go. 
<br></br>

GC: So you've got a mission statement and the company strategy, or the strategy from you as the man running the business effectively just comes from that mission statement rather than a big plan that you'd set out for all employees to understand at this point? 
<br></br>
TK: Well look I think it starts at that mission but then you say how do you make transportation as reliable as running water everywhere? Like it means you're in China, but it also means you are in Pakistan, we just launched Lahore and everywhere else in the world. OK, so that's a start but then you say everyone, and so that means you have to get the price down low enough that everyone can use it, it's that everybody moves around in their cities, how do you make it so affordable that everybody can use Uber to get around, and that's where the real innovation comes and once you see it, once you see it like that, you're like, wow the work never ends, and so that's kind of how we think about what we do. 
<br></br>
GC: When I think of a traditional company though, pricing is something that traditional companies consistently want to hold the line on because that's their margin, and they see that as something to be defended, but everywhere I look at Uber at the moment, it feels like a race to the bottom. I mean the Indian example is a very pertinent one and China, your competition here as well – how can you have a successful business where everything seems to be measured on the price and it is a race to the bottom? 
<br></br>
TK: Well, you know, I think the non-intuitive thing about our business is that the cheaper the service gets, the more luxurious it gets. Let me explain. I like to say time is a luxury. Well, when the price goes down, you have more riders because more riders can afford it. But if you have more riders that means you have more drivers, and if you have more drivers that means that your pick up times are shorter. It also means that wherever you go in a city, you're more likely to get a ride back. And so it just so happens in our business non-intuitively, when the price goes down, the system or the product or the service becomes more luxurious. And so this isn't a race to the bottom in sort of the traditional sense, it's that the lower we go, the better the service gets. And that's why we do what we do. 
<br></br>
GC: So when your local office picks up the phone and says ,Travis, bad news, we've got another competitor in our marketplace, you don't throw your hands up in the air and stamp around and say oh my god, how are we going to run a business in this market? 
<br></br>
TK: (laughs) Look I mean you know we're here in China, we have the most fierce competition here in this country. I like to say if that hypothetical happens, I know that I'm going to be losing an hour or two sleep that night and maybe for 100 nights following that, but that's part of the fun. You know it makes us better that's for sure, but it makes us better because we are just very very focused on how do we deliver a better experience for riders, how do we do a great job building a platform for drivers. 
<br></br>
GC: Have you been surprised by the resistance that you've had, I mean it's been remarkable that it's been sort of at a policy level with some governments, it's been at a rival, kind of driver system level with incumbent taxi businesses. I mean everywhere you look there seems to be something involving Uber and somebody who's kind of angry about you. 
<br></br>
TK: Well look, you know, I think the context that you have to see when it comes to Uber and specifically actually ground transportation industry around the world, is that this is an industry that has been built and designed to outlaw competition. And so when somebody or an entity comes in and represents competition for the first time in decades, it becomes, you know, some people call it disruptive, but it's about change and it's actually about positive change cos when we go to a city, we are telling cities and cities like here in China, we're like within the next year we're gonna create 20,000 jobs, we're gonna take hundreds of thousands of cars off the road which is going to make pollution in the air much better and save people time like, that's just fundamentally good, how can we bring so much good so quickly? It's because we are going into a system that had no competition before we came. And so, some places are better at sort of embracing that change than others but the change is so positive and so straight forward that it's why we're in 400 cities. It's why in all the cities that we've rolled out in we are, we still operate there. Even when it creates a little bit of angst with that change, that change is so positive that it ultimately works out. 
<br></br>
GC: Have you seen any difference in reception – bit of a broad brush question, but between developed and developing economies? 
<br></br>
TK: You know – It's really a mix, I mean the way it works for Uber is it's really city by city and every city is different. So I can't bucket Bogota and Bangalore, I can't put them in the same bucket. I can't put Stockholm in the same category as Singapore, they're all very different. Now there's different kinds of cities. What we could say about in the developing world is that the fares are really low and they're really low because often in the developing world labor is quite a bit, it's just a lot less expensive, and so that means you can get the price really far down, that means that you see hyper growth, I mean really really intense growth, because they're really in the developing world there is no reason to own a car because the price can go so low. In the developed world, the prices are much higher, labour is of course more expensive and so owning a car might be in some cases cheaper than taking Uber. Our job is to get, taking Uber cheaper than owning a car and that's where all the innovation still is to come.
