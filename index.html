Using the app requires everyone involved sign up and connect their debit card — afterward you can pay your friends back instantly with just a few taps on your phone. In most cases, the money automatically deposits in your buddy's bank account and is instantly accessible. At most, they'll have to wait 1 to 2 business days for the deposit to clear.</p></div><div class="col-2">  <p>  <img title="Cell Phone Apps" src=https://campustocareer.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/evernote-business-tips.jpg alt="Apps" width="353" height="356" />Evernote is essentially a virtual notebook you have with you everywhere—perfect for downloading whatever is bouncing around in your brain. You can make notes directly in the app, save images and articles from the web, upload pages from physical notebooks, and track tasks. Evernote can even handle audio files. The best part? Everything you add to Evernote is searchable, so you can find it next week (or even five years from now) quickly and easily.</p></div>
